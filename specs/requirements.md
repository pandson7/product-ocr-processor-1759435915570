# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This system enables automated product specification extraction from images using AWS cloud services. Users can upload product images to AWS S3 storage, which triggers an automated OCR processing pipeline using AWS Bedrock's Claude model to extract structured product information and store it in a flexible database schema.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Image Upload and Storage
**User Story:** As a system user, I want to upload product images to AWS storage, so that they can be processed automatically for specification extraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a product image is uploaded to the designated S3 bucket THE SYSTEM SHALL store the image securely with proper metadata
2. WHEN an image is successfully uploaded THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger the OCR processing pipeline automatically
3. WHEN an image upload fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and provide appropriate error handling

### Requirement 2: Automated OCR Processing
**User Story:** As a system user, I want the system to automatically extract product specifications from uploaded images, so that I can obtain structured product data without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an image is uploaded to S3 THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically trigger a Lambda function for processing
2. WHEN the Lambda function processes an image THE SYSTEM SHALL use AWS Bedrock Claude model for OCR analysis
3. WHEN OCR processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL extract product specifications in JSON format
4. WHEN the Claude model returns markdown-wrapped JSON THE SYSTEM SHALL properly parse and extract the JSON content

### Requirement 3: Product Specification Extraction
**User Story:** As a system user, I want the system to extract structured product information from images, so that I can access product details like name, brand, and other specifications in a standardized format.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN processing a product image THE SYSTEM SHALL extract product name if available
2. WHEN processing a product image THE SYSTEM SHALL extract brand information if available
3. WHEN processing a product image THE SYSTEM SHALL extract any other visible product specifications
4. WHEN extraction is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL format all information as valid JSON
5. WHEN no specifications are found THE SYSTEM SHALL return an appropriate empty or null response

### Requirement 4: Flexible Data Storage
**User Story:** As a system user, I want extracted product specifications to be stored in a flexible database schema, so that various types of product information can be accommodated without schema modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN product specifications are extracted THE SYSTEM SHALL store them in DynamoDB with a flexible schema
2. WHEN storing data THE SYSTEM SHALL include metadata such as processing timestamp and source image reference
3. WHEN storing JSON data THE SYSTEM SHALL preserve the original structure and data types
4. WHEN storage is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL provide confirmation of successful data persistence

### Requirement 5: Security and Permissions
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all AWS resources to have proper IAM permissions configured, so that the system operates securely with least-privilege access.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN deploying the system THE SYSTEM SHALL configure IAM roles with minimum required permissions
2. WHEN Lambda functions access Bedrock THE SYSTEM SHALL use the specified Claude model with proper authentication
3. WHEN Lambda functions access S3 and DynamoDB THE SYSTEM SHALL use role-based permissions without hardcoded credentials
4. WHEN processing images THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure secure data handling throughout the pipeline
